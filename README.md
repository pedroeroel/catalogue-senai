# 👋🏻 Welcome to my Catalogue!

## This is a little project I made thinking in learn a bit of Expo 🧑🏻‍💻!

In this project I list:

- Games I LOVE.
- Bands I listen to.
- Books I read.

## Technologies used in this project

- Expo (React Native)
- Tailwind CSS (NativeWind)

## How to run it.

You have to first install [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) on your system.

Done that, you'll run it using these commands.

```bash
# Install the dependencies of the project
npm install

# Start the development server
npx expo start
```

## Hope you enjoy it and know a little about me!
